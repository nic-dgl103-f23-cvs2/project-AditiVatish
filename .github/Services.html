      <h2>Foam Rollers</h2>
      <p>Foam rollers are cylindrical tools used for self-myofascial release, a form of self-massage that targets muscle tightness and trigger points. By rolling various parts of the body over the foam roller, individuals can release muscle tension, improve flexibility, and enhance overall mobility. Foam rollers come in different densities and textures, allowing users to choose the level of pressure and intensity suitable for their needs. Regular use of foam rollers can contribute to better muscle recovery and reduced muscle stiffness.</p>
