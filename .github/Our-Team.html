            <h3>Trish Leslie BScPT</h3>
            <p>Trish graduated from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh with a Bachelor’s of 
              Science in Physical Therapy, with honours, in 2011. She has worked as a 
              physiotherapist in orthopaedics, women’s health, geriatrics, neurology and sports 
              physiotherapy. Trish has also worked with rugby players at the Leith Rugby Club in 
              Edinburgh and James Bay Rugby Club in Victoria.
               Trish has worked in private practice as well as acute care since 2012. Through her 
              practice she focuses on manual therapies, physiotherapy modalities and exercise 
              prescription. Since graduating university she has continued to complete additional 
              courses in orthopaedics and women’s health as well as being certified in acupuncture

          <h3>Jared Hromika MPT, FDN/IMS</h3>
          <p>Jared graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2014 with a Masters of 
            Physical Therapy and moved to the Comox Valley with his wife in the summer of 2015. 
            Before moving to the valley, he worked in Vancouver at several locum positions in 
            private practice orthopaedics in order to gain exposure to different patient populations 
            and approaches to treatment. This experience has helped Jared consider movement 
            problems from different perspectives while providing a framework for his post graduate 
            development.
             Jared’s approach to treatment involves movement assessment, manual therapy 
            techniques, and exercise prescription in order to help you move more effectively and 
            with less pain. He also has additional training with Neurokinetic Therapy, which is a 
            method of assessment and treatment for compensation patterns that have developed 
            over the years and often go unnoticed. This helps direct treatment towards the cause of 
            your symptoms and improve your overall quality of movement.
            In addition to physiotherapy treatment, Jared is excited to provide Ascent Physiotherapy 
            with bike fitting services. He was introduced to triathlon in 2006 and has enjoyed 
            working on his bikes ever since. While enrolled in the masters program at UBC, he 
            completed additional training through the BC Division of Sport Physiotherapy Canada 
            for rider assessment and bike fit to optimize a rider’s efficiency and comfort in the 
            saddle.
             When he’s not in the clinic or on his bike, Jared enjoys many activities including 
            swimming, trail running, softball and hockey.</p>
